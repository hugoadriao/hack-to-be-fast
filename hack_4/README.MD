# Hack 4

A palindrome is a word or phrase that can be taken from left to right or right to left or even meaning.

In this challenge, the idea is to print all palindromic numbers between two other numbers.

Example 1: Given the starting number 1 and ending number 20, the serious result: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11.

Example 2: starting number 3000 and ending number 3010, or serious result: 3003.
